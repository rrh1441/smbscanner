Terms

The Licensor hereby grants you the right to copy, modify, create derivative 
works, redistribute, and use the Licensed Work in any form, with the right to 
sublicense, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below.

1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, 
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to 
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, 
   sublicense, and distribute the Licensed Work and such Derivative Works in 
   Source or Object form.

2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, 
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in 
   this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, 
   import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Work, where such license applies 
   only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
   infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
   Contribution(s) with the Licensed Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
   submitted. If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a 
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Work or 
   a Contribution incorporated within the Licensed Work constitutes direct or 
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you 
   under this License for that Licensed Work shall terminate as of the date such 
   litigation is filed.

3. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Licensed Work 
   or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and 
   in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   a. You must give any other recipients of the Licensed Work or Derivative 
      Works a copy of this License; and

   b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that 
      You changed the files; and

   c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You 
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from 
      the Source form of the Licensed Work, excluding those notices that do not 
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

   d. If the Licensed Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its 
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include 
      a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE 
      file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
      Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE 
      text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source 
      form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, 
      within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
      third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are 
      for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add 
      Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, 
      alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Licensed Work, 
      provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as 
      modifying the License.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made 
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may not, directly or indirectly, use the Licensed Work or any 
      Derivative Works for production use, including but not limited to 
      commercial use, unless you have obtained a separate license from the 
      Licensor for such production use. For purposes of this License, 
      "production use" means any use of the Licensed Work or Derivative Works 
      that is not for development, testing, or evaluation purposes.

   b. You may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
      Licensed Work.

   c. You may not use the Licensed Work or any Derivative Works in any manner 
      that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any Licensor services, 
      or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of any Licensor 
      services.

5. No Trademark License. This License does not grant permission to use the 
   trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, 
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin 
   of the Licensed Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in 
   writing, Licensor provides the Licensed Work (and each Contributor provides 
   its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
   ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any 
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining 
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Licensed Work and assume 
   any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

7. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in 
   tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by 
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to 
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any 
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability 
   to use the Licensed Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of 
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised 
   of the possibility of such damages.

8. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the 
   Licensed Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and 
   charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other 
   liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in 
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your 
   sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
   agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by 
   reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
